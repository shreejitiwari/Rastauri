It's time to upgrade your travel experience with RaStAuRi. You travel,we will make it better.

India is home to three quarters of the worldâ€™s auto-rickshaws, which 
are three-wheeled motor vehicles that are hired to move both 
people and goods (Mani and Pant, 2011). These vehicles play an 
important role in urban transport in the country, being used for a 
wide range of trip purposes, often for trips that cannot be practically 
undertaken on other types of public transport, at considerably lower 
cost than would be incurred in a taxi.  
Specifically , people who travel from railway usually hire auto for 
travelling to their destination . But it is experienced by everyone that 
as soon as a passenger comes out of the railway station , a crowd of 
auto drivers surround them & try to convince them to take their auto 
service. And this thing wastes a lot of time. 
The RaStAuRi Management system is a database based project 
executed with the help of python language and SQL .It is a system 
designed to reduce the efforts put in by people to hail auto 
rickshaws(most common and cheap means of travel) during 
travelling .It is often tiring for people to wait outside the station for 
long durations of time, negotiate for the price, look for the most 
suitable auto according to the number of passengers and luggage. 
This  system of ours will help take care of all the requirements of 
passengers in a short duration of time so that it is convenient for 
people to travel .


The objectives of the system are : 
- Making Auto rickshaw booking online.
- Creating a database of Auto rickshaws that provide their services at the railway station.
- Fixed fare for covering the same distance, so no need for bargaining.
- Reduces auto booking time.
- Can reduce crowding of auto drivers.
- Finds the most suitable auto according to the number of passengers and luggage.
- Reduces competition between the drivers.
- Supports the smart city plan.
- Makes choosing the rider easy for the auto drivers.
- Beneficial for drivers operating in remote areas.
- Helps in reducing working hours of Auto drivers, as they have to come to the station only when their service is required by the rider.
